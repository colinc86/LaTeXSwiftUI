    static let longLaTeX = "Electron temperature anisotropies and electron beams are nonthermal features of the observed nonequilibrium electron velocity distributions in the solar wind. In collision-poor plasmas these nonequilibrium distributions are expected to be regulated by kinetic instabilities through wave-particle interactions. This study considers electron instabilities driven by the interplay of core electron temperature anisotropies and the electron beam, and firstly gives a comprehensive analysis of instabilities in arbitrary directions to the background magnetic field. It clarifies the dominant parameter regime (e.g., parallel core electron plasma beta $\\beta_{\\mathrm{ec\\parallel}}$, core electron temperature anisotropy $A_{\\mathrm{ec}}\\equiv T_{\\mathrm{ec\\perp}}/T_{\\mathrm{ec\\parallel}}$, and electron beam velocity $V_{\\mathrm{eb}}$) for each kind of electron instability (e.g., the electron beam-driven electron acoustic/magnetoacoustic instability, the electron beam-driven whistler instability, the electromagnetic electron cyclotron instability, the electron mirror instability, the electron firehose instability, and the ordinary-mode instability). It finds that the electron beam can destabilize electron acoustic/magnetoacoustic waves in the low-$\\beta_{\\mathrm{ec\\parallel}}$ regime, and whistler waves in the medium- and large-$\\beta_{\\mathrm{ec\\parallel}}$ regime. It also finds that a new oblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler instability is driven by the electron beam with $V_{\\mathrm{eb}}\\gtrsim7V_{\\mathrm{A}}$ in a regime where $\\beta_{\\mathrm{ec\\parallel}}\\sim0.1-2$ and $A_{\\mathrm{ec}}&lt;1$. Moreover, this study presents electromagnetic responses of each kind of electron instability. These results provide a comprehensive overview for electron instability constraints on core electron temperature anisotropies and electron beams in the solar wind."
